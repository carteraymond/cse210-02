Group Project for BYUI programming with classes:
"Abstraction" Week03

Are you willing to play at random cards? Play Dice and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Roll 
the dice. Count the ones and fives. Each one is worth 100 and 50 points respectively. As long as you 
roll at least a one or a five you can try again. If not the game is over.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 dice 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- HILO                (source code for game)
  +-- Classes              (specific classes)
  +-- Game_start.py       (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
